API Automation Assessment
Project Overview
This project aims to automate API interactions with the Restful Booker API. The assessment
includes verifying response tokens, creating bookings, and validating the list of books. The
project is implemented using Java, Rest Assured, and TestNG, following Java clean code
guidelines.

Scenarios
Scenario 1: Verify Response Not Empty and Token Generation
• API Endpoint:
o POST https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/auth
Tools and Technologies
• Java: Programming language used for writing the test scripts.
• Rest Assured: Library for API testing.
• TestNG: Testing framework for running the test cases.
• Extent/Allure Reports: Tools for generating detailed test execution reports.
Project Structure
• src/main/java: Contains the main application code.
• src/test/java: Contains the test scripts.
• src/test/resources: Contains any test data files (e.g., Excel, JSON).
• reports: Directory where the test execution reports are stored.

Setup and Execution
Prerequisites
• JDK (Java Development Kit)
• Maven
• An IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
Generating Reports
• After test execution, the reports will be available in the reports directory. Attach the .html
report in your email.
Demo Video
• A demo video showcasing the test execution is included in the project repository. Watch the
video for a visual walkthrough of the automated scenarios.
Clean Code Practices
• Followed Java clean code guidelines, including meaningful variable names, modular methods,
and proper exception handling.
